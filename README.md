# Personal Website (my first ever website)

https://www.buildingontheclouds.com

**NOTE**: This website is currently not responsive - please view using a computer or laptop.

## To Do

1. Make the website responsive. I am currently looking into frameworks such as Hugo and Bootstrap.
2. Update *AWS Step Functions* post.
3. Add more posts.

## Future Posts
* AWS SSM Session Manager - if you are using bastion hosts, it is time to stop using them and use AWS SSM Session Manager instead!
* Getting started with Kubernetes on AWS - AWS EKS using *eksctl*.
* Boto3 and Sessions - looking at the AWS SDK for Python in detail.
* Formatting the AWS Lambda function logs.
* Testing Terraform using the *test* command.
* More later
