                For my first post, I will talk about my experience as an associate software engineer.              
                It will be on the lengthy side, but please bear with me.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Let us begin.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">Background</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                To begin with, I pursued a degree in chemistry, albeit it took longer than
                expected due to OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). But I did it! I graduated from Durham University in
                June 2019 with a BSc (2.1), at 27 years of age. However, by the end of 
                the second year, I decided that I did not want to pursue a career in chemistry anymore. It just wasn't for me. 
                Despite this, I did not find my chemistry degree a waste of time, as I got to learn 
                computational chemistry. Computational chemistry concerns the use of computers to solve 
                chemical equations and simulations. It was the field of chemistry I really enjoyed. 
                And because of computational chemistry, I got my first taste of technology. 
                I was exposed to the Linux operating system, as well as MATLAB for solving quantum mechanical 
                equations. I loved it! So, during the final year, I knew that because I liked problem solving 
                (chemistry is essentially problem solving), and the fact that I enjoyed using Linux/MATLAB, 
                I had to have a career in technology.
                <br>
                <br>
                In October, I was introduced to the AWS re/Start program â€“ a
                program designed to train individuals from a non tech background for a career in the cloud. I applied
                to the program and secured a place.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started the AWS re/Start program in November 2019, and by February 2020,
                I learnt the fundamentals of technology, as well as AWS. After graduating from the 
                program, I secured a position as Associate Software Engineer for the Cloud Engineering team at News UK 
                (now moved to the company News Corporate Services UK), and began my 
                software engineering journey in March 2020 (lockdown period). If you have not heard of News UK, 
                it is a media company that publishes British newspapers (The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times), as well 
                as doing broadcasting (talkSPORT, Times Radio, TalkTV and Virgin Radio UK).
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">Beginning software engineering</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                My first few weeks at News UK were really easy going - doing simple admin/BAU
                (business as usual) tasks, such as managing GitHub access and AWS tasks such as decomissioning systems, from the ticket queue Remedy OnDemand (switched over to Service Now). 
                It was at this point I realised I was in an advantageous position, because everyone in my team got extensive GitHub access. 
                As a result, throughout my time, I was able to look at different repos, see the work other teams did, 
                and come across techniques that I could use in my own work. With this, I will make one important point right now: 
                make good use of any access/opportunities! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I continued to work on AWS tasks, as well as learning 
                technologies such as Terraform and Docker. Given that my introduction period was rather relaxed i.e. 
                I had plenty of energy after work, I utilised my time outside of work on improving my AWS skills. I prepared for, 
                and passed, the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. It was definitely a challenging exam!
                <br>
                <br>
                From September onwards, large engineering projects were cropping up, starting with a project that involved 
                automating the deployment and configuration of a system that cleans up (deletes) unused AWS resources, built by engineers in 
                News Corp Australia. My team is part of the wider, global, engineering team, consisting of Australia, United Kingdom, and America.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">Automating the cleanup system</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Automating the cleanup system involved building Jenkins pipelines that would deploy/configure the system. 
                This was quite a challenging task, as I had to get to grips with both the system (which had extensive configuration), as well as Jenkins. 
                Even my team agreed it was challenging. But, we got there in the end, and automated the deployment for News UK. We even had a few jokes/laughs along the way 
                - this was when I made my famous Jenkins pun: "I know we are doing Jenkins, but this isn't groovy!".
                <br>
                <br>
                The project involved interacting with the engineers in Australia, as well as engineers in America - they provided access to the Jenkins server. It was really cool 
                working with the engineers in the different regions, and seeing how they worked.
                And, to complement this, I ended up passing the AWS Developer Associate exam in October. Being consistent with my learning 
                was definitely paying off!
                <br>
                <br>
                The cleanup system then underwent updates, and the requirement was to roll it out globally/across different companies. Me and my line manager would occassionally have meetings at night
                with the Australian team lead and a senior engineer (morning time in Australia), to discuss the automation/deployment. Now, despite the fact that I would sometimes have meetings at 
                night after a very tiring day of work, it was nice to be able to have a call and discuss engineering. Sure, you can
                send emails, even message on Slack, but nothing beats discussing engineering over a call!
                <br>
                <br>
                The repos were updated, and the deployment was automated such that the system could easily be deployed to any company. Success!
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">More engineering</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                After the cleanup system, I worked on more engineering projects/POCs (proof of concepts). To describe a few:
                built a CircleCI pipeline that builds and distributes golden AMIs using Packer and Vagrant,
                built a Python access keys rotation system for the AWS EKS IAM users, 
                built a pipeline that deploys IAM roles that only CircleCI can assume - improves the
                workflow security for teams doing their EKS deployments, 
                and automating the creation/sharing of managed prefix lists (IP addresses for security groups).
                I also worked with engineers in America to enrol News UK's AWS development accounts into a tool that shuts down resources at night. 
                By working on different projects, using different technologies, and being consistent with my learning, 
                I was able to improve my engineering skills, especially problem solving. 
                I strongly believe that once your problem solving skills improve, you can do anything.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">Best practices/better ways</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                As I progressed with my software engineering journey, there were a few times when I felt that some pieces of work were               
                complicated/over engineered. For example, I was tasked with building a repo to deploy SCPs (Service Control Policies) to each region's management account (still ongoing). 
                The repo was meant to be similar to the existing landing zone repos i.e. use Jenkins. However, when looking at the landing zone repos, I felt that the
                Jenkinsfiles were complicated - Groovy syntax was used extensively, and some pipelines would come close to 1000 lines.         
                <br>
                <br>
                So, when it came to building the SCPs pipeline, I took a step back, and retaught myself Jenkins. In particular,
                I focussed on what the best practices are when building a Jenkins pipeline. I subsequently built 
                the pipeline using the declarative approach. The pipeline was not only easier to read than the landing zone pipelines, it was also considerably
                shorter (under 300 lines). 
                The declarative approach, and the minimal use of Groovy, meant readable and more maintainable code. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Following this, I converted the cleanup system pipelines to declarative. The landing zone pipelines also followed suit, and were
                converted to declarative.                
                <br>
                <br>
                The point I am trying to make is, just because something has been done a certain way, does not always mean it is the best
                way. The work might not be implementing best practices, or, there might be updates/improvements to the tools/services 
                that are being used. So, if you think a piece of work could be improved, then pose the improvement 
                and discuss it (you may be asked to create a PR (pull request)).
                Furthermore, when working on a task/project, try to implement best practices.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">Documentation</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                When it comes to engineering, I love getting my hands dirty and building things. And at the beginning of my software engineering journey, I
                was not so keen on writing documentation. But, over the years, I have come to appreciate the importance of producing good documentation for your work. 
                I mean, when I am working with a new tool/service, I typically go straight to the documentation. And when the tool/service is documented 
                well, it makes working with that tool/service that much easier. And this is exactly what I experienced when working on some projects,
                especially with the cleanup system.
                <br>
                <br>
                When it came to the cleanup system, the senior engineer would update the Confluence documentation every time there was an update (a trait I 
                really admired). However, the issue with the documentation was that it was very in-depth and not easy to follow. When I was helping the operations team lead in Bangalore enrol a company into the system, 
                he said that operations staff just want simple, easy to follow, documentation. I took his comment onboard, relayed it back to the senior engineer, and worked on rewriting the documentation. 
                Although rewriting the documentation ended up being a very long task, it helped me have a greater understanding of the system, as I had to go over everything and make sure
                it was explained as simply as possible, and easy to follow.
                The updated documentation ended up being a big improvement over the original - a thumbs up from the senior engineer!
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">Confidence</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                As mentioned in the "More engineering" section, as I worked on different projects, my engineering skills increased. 
                And as my engineering skills increased, I gained more confidence. And this brings me to the point I would like to make:
                in order to build your confidence with technology, you need to get your hands dirty. What I typically do when I am given a task is to first 
                experiment/build in my team's playground/development accounts. So, I encourage people to check if their team
                have any accounts they can use as a playground.
                I also strongly recommend creating a personal account with the cloud provider that you use for work - they typically offer some sort of free tier for you to try
                out different services (please read the free tier carefully). However, I sometimes found that experimenting/building in my personal account was not feasible 
                (not enough resources, cost, etc.), so I would just use my team's playground accounts.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moreover, and please remember this, it is absolutely fine to make mistakes when coding/building! I know it's not great to see errors on your screen, especially if 
                you've been hacking away at the keyboard for like an hour or two, but that is part of the learning process. Please don't let this affect your confidence.
                It is very rare that people get stuff working on their first try. I experienced this multiple times, and still do. But, what I like to do if 
                I'm getting frustrated, is just to step away from the screen and take a break. Sometimes a short break is all you need. However, if you have been stuck for a 
                significant period of time (this will depend on the task/project), then remember, it is absolutely fine to ask for help. My advice is: 
                first, try to work on something by yourself (or with your partner if you are working in a pair), and give it your best shot. Then, if you find yourself stuck, don't delay in asking for help.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">Reflection</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                I started my software engineering journey in March 2020, and when I compare myself now to how I was when I started, I have definitely come
                a long way. When I joined News UK, I did not know what to expect - the only training I had was from the AWS re/Start program, which, despite 
                being intense, was only 3 months. So, it did not take that long after starting News UK for me to realise just how much I did not know. There were times
                when I would tell my line manager that there is just so much to learn! But, he reassured me that it was ok to feel like this, and that I would get there. And I can happily say, I am getting there!
                Being consistent as possible with my learning, working on a variety of tasks, helping my colleagues, and working with engineers in different positions (associates, 
                software engineers and seniors) has helped me greatly, especially with my confidence. I might not be an expert in any area, or with a particular tool or language, but I have increased
                my confidence level such that, if I am given something I have never done before, I will, at the very least, get the ball rolling and make good initial progress.  
                Morever, if I need to reach out to people in different teams/regions, I am happy to do so. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, despite coming a long way, I still have a long way to go. There are areas I still need to do more work on, such as GCP (I have more experience with AWS) and Kubernetes (it is a beast).
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">Final pieces of advice</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Be as consistent as possible with your engineering learning i.e. try and stick to a schedule 
                (feel free to contact me if you want some help with this - see bottom of page for contact). 
                I can guarantee you, if you are consistent with your engineering learning, you will see your skills improve quickly, and in turn your confidence. 
                Don't stop learning!
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, see if you can work on different tasks/projects. That way, you get to work with different tools/languages etc., and this will help improve your problem solving skills.             
                <br>
                <br>
                <b class="heading">My line manager</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Even though I had to work extremely hard these past few years, I must also give credit to my line manager, as he has been very supportive. 
                So, to my line manager, thank you for being supportive.
